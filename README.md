# sunspot_data
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sunspot dataset with the goal of predicting the time series and identifying its periodicity. The sunspot dataset provides a long-term record of sunspot activity observed from 1749 to the present. Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are directly related to solar magnetic activity and often exhibit periodic patterns over time.

Dataset
The sunspot dataset contains monthly total sunspot numbers, which are used as a proxy for solar activity. Each data point represents the number of sunspots observed on the Sun's surface during a specific month.

Analysis
The project employs time series analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the sunspot dataset. The primary objectives include:

- Predicting future sunspot activity based on historical data.
- Identifying periodic patterns and cycles within the time series.

Tools and Technologies
The analysis is conducted using Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib.
